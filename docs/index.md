# Decision Context Protocol (DCP)

<p align="center">
<em>Governing autonomous agent decisions prior to execution</em>
</p>

Decision Context Protocol (DCP) is a system-level protocol for governing
autonomous agent decisions prior to execution.

DCP provides a structured, auditable interface through which systems
evaluate autonomous intent against policy, context, risk, and delegation
semantics before execution occurs.

---

## What is DCP?

DCP separates decision authority from execution mechanics.

- DCP governs **whether** an action may occur
- MCP governs **how** an action is invoked

This separation enables scalable autonomy while preserving enterprise
accountability and auditability.
